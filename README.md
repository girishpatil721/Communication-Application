# Communication-Application
This is a simple communication application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with localStorage for data management. The application includes:

 â€¢ Login & Registration Pages with validation.
 â€¢ Home & Welcome Pages for navigation.
 â€¢ User List Page displaying users stored in localStorage.
 â€¢ Chat & User Data stored in localStorage for persistence.
 â€¢ Managed Documents Page with file upload, validation, and sharing features. Only the uploader and shared users can view files.
 â€¢ Logout Button to clear session data.
This project demonstrates localStorage-based authentication, user management, chat handling, and document sharing within a simple web-based interface. ðŸš€
